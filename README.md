ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment and management of a secure dynamic website on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with robust monitoring and automation.

Key Features

VM Creation & Configuration: Created and configured multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) on GCP.

Website Deployment: Hosted a dynamic website using Nginx as the web server.

Secure Deployment: Configured a custom domain with SSL/TLS certificates for secure access (HTTPS).

Set up Google Cloud SQL with MySQL for secure, scalable, and managed database services.

Cloud Networking & DNS Management: Implemented provisioning, DNS configuration, and network setup for reliable connectivity.

Intrusion Detection & Monitoring: Integrated Suricata for intrusion detection and real-time monitoring.

Automation: Set up automated backups using Crontab, reducing manual workload and improving operational efficiency.
